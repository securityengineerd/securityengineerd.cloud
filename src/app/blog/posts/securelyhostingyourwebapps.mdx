# Overview 

This guide shows you how to securely expose your web application using **Cloudflare Tunnels**. The benefits of this configuration is you are hosting without a reverse proxy service, without LetsEncrypt, and without directly exposing a single IP address or port to the internet. It also eliminates the need of maintaining a config for each upsteam application and PKI for each application. Consider this method to be a security engineer's preferred hosting method.

## Prerequisites
- Domain Name (one you own)  
- Cloudflare account (free)  
- Web application running on your server (bound to `localhost`, e.g., `http://localhost:8080`). 
> Warning: Make it is not bound to http://0.0.0.0:8080! That will expose it to all addresses including your server's public address on port 8080. Ensure it only runs on http://localhost:8080 or http://127.0.0.1:8080!  
- SSH access to your server (for tunnel connector install and port-forwarding to remote application)  

---

## Step 1: Create a Free Cloudflare Account
1. Go to [https://www.cloudflare.com](https://www.cloudflare.com).  
2. Click **Start for Free**.  
3. Complete the signup (requires a card, but the free plan is 100% free). 

I have never been charged a single penny, don't let the card prompt freak you out.

## Step 2: Setup DNS 
1. In the dashboard, click **Add a Site**.  
2. Choose **Manually Enter DNS Records**.  
3. Set your registrar’s nameservers to the **Cloudflare values** (shown in the dashboard).  

> Do not proceed beyond this point until you have logged into your domain registrar and set the name servers to the Cloudflare provided values.

## Step 3: Install and Configure Cloudflare Tunnel Connector
1. In Cloudflare, select **Zero Trust → Networks → Tunnels**.  
2. Click **Create a Tunnel** → choose **Cloudflared**.  
3. Enter a name for your tunnel (e.g., `linode-lax-dev01`). 
  - If you have multiple hosting providers, locations, and servers the above naming convension helps to identify all of the above. 
4. Select your server’s operating system.  
5. Run the two provided commands:  

   - **First command**: installs Cloudflared and links it to your Cloudflare account.  
   - **Second command**: enables the tunnel to start at boot.  

---

## Step 4: Expose Your Web Application
1. Inside the tunnel settings, add a **Public Hostname**:  
   - **Subdomain**: *(leave blank — this will be your root domain)*  
   - **Domain**: select your domain  
   - **Service**: HTTP  
   - **URL**: `localhost:8080` (or your app’s local port)  
2. Click **Save Tunnel**.  
3. Add another **Public Hostname** for `www`:  
   - **Subdomain**: `www`  
   - **Service**: HTTP  
   - **URL**: `localhost:8080`  
4. Save.  

Your app is now accessible at both:  
- `https://yourdomain.com`  
- `https://www.yourdomain.com`  

Cloudflare automatically handles SSL for you.

## Step 5: Add More Applications (Optional)
Want multiple apps on the same server? Just add more hostnames:  

- `api.yourdomain.com → localhost:3000`  
- `blog.yourdomain.com → localhost:5000`  

---

## Step 6: Development Access (Optional)
If you want to preview your app securely during development, forward the port via SSH:  

```bash
ssh -R 8080:localhost:8080 username@yourserver.tld
```

Open your web browser to http://localhost:8080 to view your application locally.

## Benefits of This Setup

- Eliminates the need for a reverse proxy service.
- Eliminates the need for paid SSL certificates and LetsEncrypt — Cloudflare provides certificates automatically
- Reduced server exposure — DNS records are proxied through Cloudflare masking your real IPv4/IPv6 address, allows you to host applications without exposing common server ports such as 80, 443.
- Easy scaling — easily add new domains and applications, just add the domain into Cloudflare DNS and create public hostnames within the tunnel settings.

Hopefully I've made your hosting experience easier through this tutorial. You should now have a securely deployed website using Cloudflare Tunnels.
