# Overview 

Today you will learn how to securely host web applications. The following configuration features **minimal configuration**, absolutely **ZERO port-exposure**, **proxied DNS records**, and **free SSL encryption**. Benefits made possible to the Zero-Trust offerings of **Cloudflare** and their **tunnel connector**. 

With nearly 20 years of hosting experience, it's the best method I've found to date. We will only be covering a small portion of Cloudflare's services today, specifically their **Tunnel Connector**. Yet there are other awesome features which I will post about soon. Stay tuned...

## Setup Requirements

- Registered Domain Name
- Cloudflare Account (free account)  
- Web Application (bound to `localhost:port`, example `http://127.0.0.1:8080`)
> Warning: Make absolutely sure the instance is NOT configured using "0.0.0.0" as the listening address! It allows the instance to accept connections from ANY address across all interfaces, including internet-facing addresses. Our hosted application will have ZERO public port-exposure, the only acceptable listening address is "127.0.0.1".
- Server ssh access (tunnel connector install, optional port-forwarding to local workstation to access remote application)

## Step 1: Create a Free Cloudflare Account
1. Go to [https://www.cloudflare.com](https://www.cloudflare.com).  
2. Click **Start for Free**.  
3. Complete the signup (requires a card, but the free plan is 100% free). 

I have never been charged a single penny, don't let the card prompt freak you out.

## Step 2: DNS Configuration
1. In the Cloudflare dashboard, select **"Add a Site"**.  
2. Select **Manually Enter DNS Records**.  
3. Set your registrar’s nameservers to the Cloudflare provided values.  

> DNS "usually" updates fairly quickly, in rare occurences it may take up-to 24 hours. You can check propagation by location using whatsmydns.net. It will query your search against location-specific DNS servers and display it's current value.

## Step 3: Install and Configure Cloudflare Tunnel Connector
1. In Cloudflare, select **Zero Trust → Networks → Tunnels**.  
2. Click **Create a Tunnel** → select the **Cloudflared** option.
3. Choose a name for your tunnel (example: linode-lax-dev01). 
  - Solid naming convention if you utilize multiple hosting providers, regions, and servers.
4. Select your server’s operating system.  
5. Execute the two commands provided via shell (top, bottom-left boxes):  

   - **1. (top)**: installs Cloudflare tunnel connector.  
   - **2. (bottom-left)**: enables the tunnel upon boot.  

---

## Step 4: Web Application Configuration
1. In the tunnel settings under the tab **Published Application Routes**, select **Add a published application route**.
2. Input the following fields:
   - **Subdomain**: *(leave blank — this will be your root domain)*  
   - **Domain**: select your domain  
   - **Service**: HTTP  
   - **URL**: `localhost:your_selected_port` (example: localhost:8080)  
2. Click **Save Tunnel**.  
3. Now we configure our **www** sub-domain:  
   - **Subdomain**: `www`  
   - **Domain**: select your domain
   - **Service**: HTTP  
   - **URL**: `localhost:8080`  
4. Save.  

Congratulations, try out your newly configured application complete with SSL encryption.a    
- `https://yourdomain.com`  
- `https://www.yourdomain.com`  

Cloudflare makes hosting webapps a breeze and eliminates the dependency of a reverse-proxy service such as nginx. No more wasted time updating nginx configs and generating SSL certificates. Your application is SSL encrypted automatically.

## Step 5: Add More Applications (Optional)
Want multiple apps on the same server? Repeat step four adding additional published application routes. Routes can even be configured to other domains that you manage on Cloudflare.  

- `api.yourdomain.com → localhost:3000`  
- `blog.yourdomain.com → localhost:5000`  

---

## Step 6: Development Access (Optional)

In the early stages of development you will obviously want to preview your work. To accomplish this we will use SSH port-forwarding to expose our remotely hosted application to our development machine. 

```bash
ssh -R 8080:localhost:8080 username@yourserver.tld
```

Once the connection has been established, simply open your browser to http://localhost:8080

## Benefits of This Setup

- Eliminates the need for a reverse proxy service.
- Eliminates the need for paid SSL certificates and LetsEncrypt — Cloudflare provides certificates automatically
- Reduced server exposure — DNS records are proxied through Cloudflare masking your real IPv4/IPv6 address, allows you to host applications without exposing common server ports such as 80, 443.
- Easy scaling — easily add new domains and applications, just add the domain into Cloudflare DNS and create public hostnames within the tunnel settings.
