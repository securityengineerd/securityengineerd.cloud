# Overview 

This guide shows you how to securely host web application with ZERO port-exposure, thanks to **Cloudflare** for their **Tunnel Connector**. Using this configuration requires minimal up-keep without the need for a reverse-proxy service, buying a SSL certificate, or worse yet Lets Encrypt. Cloudflare also lets you proxy DNS requests as well, eliminating direct exposure of your server's IP addresses. With over 20+ years experience in web hosting and 12+ yrs in hosting high-availability enterprise applications, it is how this Security Engineer hosts webapps. :)

## Prerequisites
- Domain Name
- Cloudflare User Account (free account)  
- Existing web application (bound to `localhost:port`, example `http://127.0.0.1:8080`)
> Warning: Make absolutely sure that the instance is NOT configured to use "0.0.0.0" as the listening address! Using '0.0.0.0' causes the instance to accept connections from any address, including your host's internet-facing addresses. Definitely NOT what we want. Our configuration will have ZERO public port-exposure, the only acceptable listening address is "127.0.0.1".
- Server shell access. (For tunnel connector install, optional port-forwarding to local workstation to access remote application)

## Step 1: Create a Free Cloudflare Account
1. Go to [https://www.cloudflare.com](https://www.cloudflare.com).  
2. Click **Start for Free**.  
3. Complete the signup (requires a card, but the free plan is 100% free). 

I have never been charged a single penny, don't let the card prompt freak you out.

## Step 2: Setup DNS 
1. In the dashboard, click **Add a Site**.  
2. Choose **Manually Enter DNS Records**.  
3. Set your registrar’s nameservers to the **Cloudflare values** (shown in the dashboard).  

> Do not proceed beyond this point until you have logged into your domain registrar and set the name servers to the Cloudflare provided values.

## Step 3: Install and Configure Cloudflare Tunnel Connector
1. In Cloudflare, select **Zero Trust → Networks → Tunnels**.  
2. Click **Create a Tunnel** → choose **Cloudflared**.  
3. Enter a name for your tunnel (e.g., `linode-lax-dev01`). 
  - If you have multiple hosting providers, locations, and servers the above naming convension helps to identify all of the above. 
4. Select your server’s operating system.  
5. Run the two provided commands on your server:  

   - **First command**: installs Cloudflared and links it to your Cloudflare account.  
   - **Second command**: enables the tunnel to start at boot.

## Step 4: Expose Your Web Application
1. Inside the tunnel settings, add a **Public Hostname**:  
   - **Subdomain**: *(leave blank — this will be your root domain)*  
   - **Domain**: select your domain  
   - **Service**: HTTP  
   - **URL**: `localhost:8080` (or your app’s local port)  
2. Click **Save Tunnel**.  
3. Add another **Public Hostname** for `www`:  
   - **Subdomain**: `www`  
   - **Service**: HTTP  
   - **URL**: `localhost:8080`  
4. Save.  

Your app is now accessible at both:  
- `https://yourdomain.com`  
- `https://www.yourdomain.com`  

Cloudflare automatically handles SSL for you.

## Step 5: Add More Applications (Optional)
Want multiple apps on the same server? Just add more hostnames:  

- `api.yourdomain.com → localhost:3000`  
- `blog.yourdomain.com → localhost:5000`  

---

## Step 6: Development Access (Optional)
If you want to preview your app securely during development, forward the port via SSH:  

```bash
ssh -R 8080:localhost:8080 username@yourserver.tld
```

Open your web browser to http://localhost:8080 to view your application locally.

## Benefits of This Setup

- Eliminates the need for a reverse proxy service.
- Eliminates the need for paid SSL certificates and LetsEncrypt — Cloudflare provides certificates automatically
- Reduced server exposure — DNS records are proxied through Cloudflare masking your real IPv4/IPv6 address, allows you to host applications without exposing common server ports such as 80, 443.
- Easy scaling — easily add new domains and applications, just add the domain into Cloudflare DNS and create public hostnames within the tunnel settings.

Hopefully I've made your hosting experience easier through this tutorial. You should now have a securely deployed website using Cloudflare Tunnels.
