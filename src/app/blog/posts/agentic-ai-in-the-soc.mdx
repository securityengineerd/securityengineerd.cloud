    As we encroach on the age of artificial intelligence, we're going to see this technology emerge in enterprise security. Which is why I wanted to write on the potential benefits and pitfalls of utilizing artificial intelligence in the SOC. I believe this technology will change the dynamics of incident response whether we like it, or not. It's coming... 

    In my career I have yet to encounter a SOC leveraging agentic AI in it's investigation processes. I recently interviewed for a role that if selected, I will have an opportunity to put my theories to the test. One major advantage I can guarentee will be increased operational efficiency. I'll continue to update as efforts progress. Until then, take a look at the potential benefits of agentic IR. 

# Agentic IR: The Benefits

What are the benefits of AI assisted IR? Will all these gains result in the potential loss of human staff? Unlikely, oversight by human analysts will remain an essential part of enterprise security. Artificial intelligence will become another essential to an investigators toolkit allowing investigators to accomplish far more in less time. Lets take a look at what we can expect leveraging AI... 

1. Tier-1 Analysis Efficiency Sky-Rockets

> Investigation data is enriched though the AI's ability to continually triage and correlate SEIM, EDR, OSINT, and network traffic analysis. It's ability to produce an easy-to-understand summary will  allow investigators to focus on remediation rather than their tool navigation abilities.

> Benefit: Reduces false-positive triage times from hours to minutes.

2. Faster Containment

> Executing predefined containment playbooks (e.g., isolate hosts, disable user accounts, or revoke API keys) quickly puts a stop to detected threats. Especially useful when investigators are in short supply or high-volumes of events. 

> Benefit: Reduced MTTC

3. Contextual Reasoning Across Tools

> Investigator's time is usually wasted switching between this tool and that (SIEM, SOAR, EDR, CMDB, OSINT, etc.). Agentic AI unifies reasoning by querying APIs to produce a single contextual narrative.

> Benefit: Investigators get summarized explanations (“This credential reuse originated from the compromised bastion host”) rather than the investigator creating a summary from navigating multiple alerts. 
 
4. Continuous Threat Hunting

> By leveraging AI as a Jr. Threat-Hunter, vulnerability scanning will be performed around-the-clock. With the ability to integrate live threat-intelligence feeds, new detection capabilities are acquired at a moment's notice on new and emerging threats. Blocklists receive continious updates, reducing the likelyhood of compromise and infection through employee web activites during their day-to-day operations. 

> Benefit: Proactive security posture allows SOC members to focus on threat-preventention rather than threat-response. 

5. Unified Source of Knowledge

> AI Agents can learn and adapt from historical investigations and their outcomes, integrating tribal-knowledge (how do we usually handle this alert type?) into documentation platforms and repeatable workflows.

> Benefit: Reduced dependency on individual expertise. 

# Agentic IR: The Pitfalls

We have already discussed the benefits of Artificial Intelligence aided investigations. What are the potential pitfalls of agentic investigations? What mitigations can be put in place to address these problems? 

1. Over-Automation and False Positives

> Unexpected results could occur if an agent was trained using bad training data. Outage events could occur if the agent  isolates critical production servers, disables service accounts, or blocks IP addresses of a CDN or business essential SAAS providers. 

> Mitigation: Implement workflows involving human over-sight on potentially evasive actions

2. Opaque Decision-Making (“Black Box” Risk)

> Many AI systems can’t explain why they made a decision. In the world of enterprise security that is not acceptable, decisions need to be auditable for compliance and trust.

> Mitigation: Favor LLMs which provide better reasoning capabilities, structured logs, and decision trees.

3. Sensitive Data Leaks

> Feeding sensitive un-redacted log data or threat intel into an external AI model comes with several risks: interception, vendor compromise, or possible violations of compliance requirements 

> Mitigation: Leverage on-prem AI deployments over SaaS.

4. New Threat Adaptationx

> Attack methods evolve faster than static AI models. Without continuous training, AI agents could fail to detect emerging TTPs.

> Mitigation: Integrate new training data into the deployment pipeline which leverages live threat intel. Regularly conduct simulated attacks to ensure agent response is to desired specifications. 

5. Skill Degradation

> Over-reliance on AI could cause SOC members to unconditionally accept the AI's determination. In situations that may warrant an exception due to select circumstances, AI determination could result in disciplinary action or loss of employment.

> Mitigation: Don't let AI make the final determination, investigators need to make the final judgement call. 

6. AI Manipulation

> Like humans, AI are also subject to manipulation. Prompt-injection and data poisoning can lead to unexpected behaviors and outcomes. 

> Mitigation: Harden ingestion pipelines, input sanitization, and continuous monitoring for adversarial manipulation.
