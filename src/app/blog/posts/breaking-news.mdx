# Breaking News

After months of searching, I’m thrilled to share that I’ve accepted a new role as Senior Security Engineer at Isagenix.

I applied for the position two weeks ago and received a call from their HR department to schedule my first interview. During the virtual meeting with the Director of IT and one of their engineers, I gained a clear understanding of their current security toolstack and immediate challenges.

The company currently lacks formal security alerting or a dedicated Security Operations Center (SOC). The person hired for this role will be responsible for implementing a SOC from the ground up — including security policies, governance, standard operating procedures, automation, everything. 

I get an email a couple days later, an invite for an in-person interview the following week. It seemed like the longest week every, so I utilized this time to prepare for my in-person interview. I took the liberty of performing a non-evasive security assessment of their website, identifying risks, associated CVEs, and remediation recommendations. I also created a PowerPoint showcasing the company history, existing toolstack, identified needs, and put together a roadmap and timeline "SOC Implementation Essentials", outlining a three-phase SOC implementation plan. 

Interview day started off chaotic, seems there is never enough time to accomplish everything. I seriously needed a haircut, except I was too broke to get one. I took a gamble and decided to cut my own hair, thankfully my wife touched-up the back-portion I couldn't see. We got to the interview location right on-time, everything fell into place from there. The individuals conducting the interview were awesome, they will definitely make an awesome team. 

A few hours after the interview, I got a call with a job offer. Gladly I accepted, I’m looking forward to the challenges ahead — building, optimizing, and securing from the ground up — and I’m even more excited to work alongside such a talented and collaborative team. When you have a strong team, the things you can accomplish are truly remarkable.
