After a seemingly never-ending job search, I accepted a new role as Senior Security Engineer.

I applied for the position two weeks ago and received a call from their HR department to schedule my first interview. During the virtual meeting with the Director of IT and their lead engineer, I was able to get a good idea of their immediate security needs. The position will be responsible for building a formal security operations center from the ground up, defining security policies, controls, governance, the works. 

I get an email a couple days later with an invite for an in-person interview, scheduled for the following week. It was the longest week of my life, however I utilized this time to prepare for my in-person interview. 

I took the liberty of performing a non-evasive security assessment of their website, identifying risks, associated CVEs, and remediation recommendations. I geeked out on creating a PowerPoint showcasing research I've done on their company and it's history, existing toolstack, identified needs, and put together a roadmap and timeline "SOC Implementation Essentials", outlining a three-phase SOC implementation plan. 

Interview day started off chaotic, seems there is never enough time to accomplish everything. I seriously needed a haircut, I was just too broke to get one. I took a gamble and decided to cut my own hair, thankfully my wife touched-up the back-portion I couldn't see. I made it to the interview location right on-time, everything fell into place from there. The individuals conducting the interview were awesome, they will definitely make an awesome team. 

A few hours after the interview, I got a call with a job offer. Gladly I accepted, I’m looking forward to the challenges ahead — building, optimizing, and securing from the ground up. I have a feeling working with this team that we are going to accomplish great things.
