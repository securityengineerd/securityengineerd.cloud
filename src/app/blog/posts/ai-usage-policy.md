## I. PURPOSE

The purpose of this policy is to define guidelines for the appropriate use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) tools within COMPANY_NAME. It aims to encourage the efficient and secure utilization of AI, while mitigating associated risks.

## II. SCOPE

This policy applies to all employees and covers the use of all AI tools authorized by COMPANY_NAME.

## III. POLICY

### 1. Authorized Use

Only employees authorized by COMPANY_NAME who have received the necessary training are permitted to use AI tools. This authorization process is necessary to ensure that users understand the capabilities and limitations of these tools and how to use them in an effective and responsible manner. The only generative AI authorized by COMPANY_NAME is Microsoft Copilot and GitHub Copilot. Use of any other generative AI tooling is strictly prohibited.

### 2. Data Security and Confidentiality

Preservation of company data security, intellectual property, and confidentiality is paramount in all activities, including the use of AI tools. As these tools learn and generate content based on the input data, it is crucial that users do not input sensitive information, such as customer data, confidential contracts, details about partnerships, projects, work statements, or any other proprietary information.

Furthermore, users must respect the legal and ethical boundaries concerning data privacy. If an employee is unsure whether specific information is appropriate to use with the AI tool, they should consult any of the following: 1) supervisor 2) security operations center 3) or legal department. Violations of data security and confidentiality guidelines may result in disciplinary action, up to possible termination of employment.

### 3. Use of AI Tools as Supplemental Resources

Artificial Intelligence tools are a valuable resource intended to enhance productivity and decision-making processes. These tools are intended to compliment, not replace traditional methods of problem-solving, professional judgment, and human expertise.

While AI can assist in generating ideas, insights, or recommendations, users must critically evaluate all AI outputs to ensure accuracy, reliability, and alignment with the COMPANY_NAME business model and the best interests of the company and its clients.

Employees are encouraged to collaborate with colleagues to gain diverse perspectives, verify AI-generated information, and reduce the risk of errors and biases.

All AI development outputs should be validated through reliable sources, appropriately tested, and authorized by the AI subject-matter-expert before being employed in a production environment.

By using AI to compliment our daily efforts we increase productivity, while still retaining human oversight and sound judgement.

### 4. Risk Assessments for Artificial Intelligence Usage

Employees should remain aware of the inherent risks associated with AI tools, these could include inaccurate/biased output, legalities of content ownership, or potential privacy and confidentiality risks. It's important to always be critical and cautious when using AI-generated content.

We are working to integrate AI-related risk assessments into the existing risk management framework through continuous evaluation and updates to procedures. Using this process we will work to identify, assess, and mitigate the associated risks to using AI tools.

Management will ensure empoyees participate in regular training sessions and awareness programs to help employees stay informed about the risks associated to AI tools, safeguards, and best practices for responsible usage.

By maintaining ongoing oversight and proactive risk management, COMPANY_NAME can leverage AI tools effectively while minimizing the potential legal, ethical, and operational impacts.

### 5. Use of Third-Party AI Platforms

Employees are prohibited from using unapproved third-party AI platforms for company work. Use of such tools without authorization may result in data exposure, intellectual property loss, or non-compliance with company security policies.

Requests to evaluate or adopt new third-party AI tools must be submitted to the Security Operations Center (SOC) for review and approval.

### 6. Communications

When used appropriately, AI tools can enhance internal communication efficiency at COMPANY_NAME—such as by assisting in drafting emails, generating internal announcements, or automating responses.

Employees must ensure that all AI-generated communications comply with company policies on harassment, discrimination, confidentiality, and professional conduct. AI-assisted messages should always reflect the respectful, professional, and considerate tone expected in all workplace interactions.

Employees are responsible for reviewing and editing AI-generated communications before distribution to ensure accuracy, clarity, and appropriateness.

Any misuse of AI tools for communication—including generating or sharing content that violates company policies—will be treated as a serious policy violation and may result in disciplinary action, up to and including termination of employment.

### 7. Research and Development

AI tools, including language models, machine learning algorithms, and other advanced analytics can be powerful assets in COMPANY_NAME’s research and development efforts. They can support data analysis, trend identification, rapid prototyping, and creative innovation, helping teams work more efficiently and effectively.

All AI use within research and development must strictly adhere to COMPANY_NAME’s intellectual property and data security policies. Any intellectual property created through the use of AI tools is the sole property of COMPANY_NAME. Unauthorized use, sharing, or distribution of AI-generated materials may result in disciplinary action, up to and including termination of employment.

Data used in conjunction with AI tools, whether proprietary, customer-related, or sensitive in nature must be handled in compliance with established data protection protocols. This includes proper anonymization or redaction of sensitive information and ensuring access is restricted to authorized personnel only.

By maintaining strong governance and data protection standards, COMPANY_NAME ensures that AI continues to be a trusted driver of innovation while safeguarding the company’s intellectual and data assets.

### 8. Personal Use

AI tools provided by COMPANY_NAME are intended solely for business purposes and not to be used for personal activities. This policy ensures a professional work environment, safeguards company resources, and protects against legal, security, and compliance implications.

Personal use of company-provided AI tools may result in unintended sharing of inappropriate or sensitive information, misuse of company assets, or violation of data privacy and confidentiality regulation. Employees are therefore required to refrain from using AI tools for non-work-related tasks or discussions.

If the distinction between professional and personal use is unclear—such as in cases involving professional development or training, employees should seek guidance or approval from their supervisor or the security operations team before proceeding.

Misuse of AI tools for personal purposes is considered a serious policy violation and may result in disciplinary action, up to and including termination of employment.

### 9. Monitoring

COMPANY_NAME reserves the right to monitor all interactions with AI tools for the purpose of ensuring compliance with this policy.

### 10. Policy Violations

Any suspected or confirmed violations of this policy will prompt an investigation by the Security Operations Center (SOC), in coordination with the company’s data forensics specialists. Investigation findings will be reported to the employee’s immediate supervisor and the Human Resources Department for review and appropriate action.

Violations of this policy may result in disciplinary measures, up to and including termination of employment, depending on the nature and severity of the infraction. All investigations will be conducted confidentially, fairly, and in accordance with company policies and applicable laws.

## IV. POLICY COMPLIANCE

All employees, contractors, and third parties who use AI tools on behalf of COMPANY_NAME are responsible for complying with this policy and all related procedures. Managers are expected to ensure that their teams understand and follow these requirements in their daily work.

The Security Operations Center (SOC), in coordination with the Compliance and Human Resources departments, will oversee adherence to this policy through regular reviews, audits, and monitoring of AI usage where appropriate.

Employees who become aware of any misuse, potential violation, or security concern related to AI tools must report it immediately to their supervisor, the SOC, or the HR department. Reports will be handled confidentially and investigated in accordance with company policy.

COMPANY_NAME will review and update this policy as AI technologies, legal requirements, and business needs evolve to ensure continued compliance and responsible innovation.

## V. REVIEW AND REVISION

This policy will be reviewed and updated on a regular basis to ensure its continued relevance and effectiveness as AI technologies, business processes, and regulatory requirements evolve.

The Security Operations Center (SOC), in collaboration with the Compliance, Legal, and Human Resources departments, is responsible for coordinating the review process. Reviews will typically occur annually, or more frequently if significant changes in AI technology, legal standards, or organizational priorities occur.

Proposed revisions will be submitted to executive leadership for approval prior to implementation. Once approved, updated versions of this policy will be communicated to all employees, and additional training will be provided as needed to ensure understanding and compliance.

Employees are encouraged to provide feedback or raise concerns regarding the policy’s effectiveness or clarity by contacting their supervisor, the SOC, or the HR department.
