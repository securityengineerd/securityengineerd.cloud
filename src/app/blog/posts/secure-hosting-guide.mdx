# Overview

Today you will learn how to securely host web applications. I started creating web applications when I was ten, having access to my own dedicated server since twelve. I'm having trouble processing this (or would rather not) however, I have 28 years experience in hosted applications. (holy shit, where did the time go?) I'm only covering one specific Cloudflare service today, their zero-trust **Tunnel Connector**. I'll cover some of their other services at a later date. 

## Advantages

- Eliminates need for a reverse-proxy service + time spent managing configs for each upstream application
- Free SSL Encryption, you will be free from generating LetsEncrypt certificates, paid certificates, and updating reverse-proxy configs!
- Masks your IPv4/IPv6 address with proxying of DNS records. Check out this nmap port scan results snippet against securityengineerd.com... that is not my server's address ;)

```
Scanning securityengineerd.com (172.67.222.134) [1000 ports]
Discovered open port 8080/tcp on 172.67.222.134
Discovered open port 443/tcp on 172.67.222.134
Discovered open port 8443/tcp on 172.67.222.134
```

- ZERO public-port exposure. Even if someone had your actual IPv4/IPv6 address, there are no open ports!
- Easily Scales. Spun up a new docker app? Simply add a new published application route.

## Setup Requirements

- Registered Domain Name
- Cloudflare Account (free account)  
- Web Application (bound to `localhost:port`, example `http://127.0.0.1:8080`)
> Note: What application you run doesn't matter, it could be WordPress, Joomla, Drupal, Express, Flask, Django, Spring, Phoenix, .NET, React, Angular, Vue, Apollo, or even if its running Dockerized. The important part that does matter is below.

> Warning: Make absolutely sure the instance is NOT configured using "0.0.0.0" as the listening address! It allows the instance to accept connections from ANY address across all interfaces, including internet-facing addresses. Our hosted application will have ZERO public port-exposure, the only acceptable listening address is "127.0.0.1".
- Server Access
> We need access to the server whether it be physical, VMware console, shell, KVM, RDP, Webmin, or proxy via trained typing-gerbil. We just need **something** to install our tunnel connector.

## Step 1: Cloudflare Account Creation

What I am about to say might be obvious, skip this section if you already have one. Instead, login. :)

1. Go to [https://www.cloudflare.com](https://www.cloudflare.com).  
2. Click **Start for Free**.  
3. Complete the signup (requires a card, but the free plan is 100% free). 

I have never been charged a single penny, don't let the card prompt freak you out. 

---

## Step 2: DNS Configuration

1. In the Cloudflare dashboard, select **"Add a Site"**.  
2. Select **Manually Enter DNS Records**.  
3. Set your registrar’s nameservers to the Cloudflare provided values.  

> Normally, updates to records and nameservers quickly propagate. In rare occurences, changes could potentially take up-to forty-eight hours (TTL depending). You can check propagation using **whatsmydns.net** to query records against location-specific servers.

---

## Step 3: Tunnel Connector Setup
1. In the Cloudflare dashboard, navigate to **Zero Trust → Networks → Tunnels**
2. Click **Create a Tunnel** → selecting the **Cloudflared** option.
3. Choose a name for your tunnel (example: linode-lax-dev01). 
> provider-location=server is a solid naming convention if you utilize multiple hosting providers, regions, and servers.
4. Select the target hosts operating system.
5. (Unix-based servers): Run the commands provided. (top, bottom-left boxes):  

   - **1. (top)**: installs Cloudflare tunnel connector.  
   - **2. (bottom-left)**: enables tunnel service at boot

---

## Step 4: Published Application Route Setup

1. In tunnel settings, select **Published Application Routes**, then **Add a published application route**.
2. Input prompted fields:
   - **Subdomain**: *(leave blank — this will be your root domain)*  
   - **Domain**: select your domain  
   - **Service**: HTTP  
   - **URL**: `localhost:your_applications_port` (example: localhost:8080)  
2. Click **Save Tunnel**.  
3. Configure additional desired routes such as the **www** sub-domain:  
   - **Subdomain**: `www`  
   - **Domain**: select your domain
   - **Service**: HTTP  
   - **URL**: `localhost:8080`  
4. Save.  

Congratulations, try out your newly configured SSL encrypted application.

- `https://yourdomain.com`  
- `https://www.yourdomain.com`  

Cloudflare makes hosting a breeze and eliminates the dependency of a reverse-proxy service such as nginx. No more wasted time updating upsteam application configs and generating SSL certificates.

## Step 5: Need to configure more applications? (Optional)

Simply repeat step four, routes can even be configured to other domains that you manage with Cloudflare.  

- `api.yourdomain.com → localhost:3000`  
- `blog.yourdomain.com → localhost:5000`  

---

## Step 6: Optional Development Access

One method to preview your web applications is via ssh port-forwarding. To accomplish this we will expose our application's local address to our workstation. By doing this we can access the remote application using **http://localhost:remote_app_port**. 

```bash
ssh -R 8080:localhost:8080 username@yourserver.tld
```
