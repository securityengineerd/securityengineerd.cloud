After a seemingly endless search for employment, I accepted a new role as Senior Security Engineer. I applied for the role some time ago, I got an email from their HR department to schedule a quick call. A couple days later I got a virtual meeting invite for an interview with the Director of IT and their lead engineer.

In the virtual interview I was able to get a good idea of their immediate security needs. Responsibilities would include building-out a formal security operations center from the ground up, defining security policies, controls, governance, all the things you would find in any enterprise environment. 

I get an email a couple days later with an invite for an in-person interview. The earliest time was a week away, it felt like the longest week of my life. Beingf that this was the only face-to-face interview I was able to get since my last contract ended, I went full-geek on this one (security assessment, powerpoint) utilizing the time to prepare.

I put together a security assessment of their website after running some non-evasive scans. I identified each service running on the host, service versions, associated CVEs, and recommendations to improve the security posture of their site. Following the assessment I put together a PowerPoint showing I took the time to research the company and understood their needs. I drafted up a SOC Implementation Essentials with SOAR Integration roadmap and three-phase timeline assuming zero existing security posture. 

Eventually the day of the interview came, starting off rather chaotic. I wanted to get my hair-cut the day before but wasn't able to due to finanical constraints. Amazingly my wife has kept our heads above water while I've been looking for a new position, she is pretty amazing. She currently attends Arizona College of Nursing, in 2027 she will graduate a BSN. Attending school while also working full-time as an EMT Security Guard and private-duty Care-Giver/CNA. Once I start this role and get some money coming in she can focus on school again. 

Back to interview day, basically I refused to not look my absolute best going to an interview. I had shaved my head for years, only recently I started to let it grow. Taking a gamble I grabbed the clippers shaving the sides and fading it, figured in the worst-case scenario I'd revert to my old hair-style. Surprisingly it turned-out perfect, my wife had to touch up the back due to visual limitations. I'll assume luck played a big part. Not going to be cutting my own hair again, at least not anytime soon. 

I arrived to the interview just in-time, meeting Jesse and his colleague at the door. We went to the interview room, which I started to hand-out the security assessment as we sat down. After going over the assessment, I jokingly apologized for geeking-out on this and stated that I made a PowerPoint... I'm pretty sure that was the last thing they expected. About mid-way through the presentation my mouth started to dry out, you know that feeling when you try to talk? I apologized stating my mouth was kind of dry, they were kind enough to get me some water. After that we took a trip down to the offices, I got to meet some of the individuals from HR. It was pretty cool, they loaded me up with a bag of sample products. 

As we were walking out I causally tried probing for information, specifically trying to get an idea of how many canidates were being considered. The response concerned me a little, he stated they couldn't share that information. I thought to myself maybe I didn't establish enough rapport, hoping that question didn't blow the interview. My wife asked how it went, I told her I thought it went well. I guess we will see...

Later that day I received a couple calls from a blocked number, I don't answer those. I use a seperate number while searching for jobs which I unconditionally answer. Thankfully I checked my email, the lady from HR sent an email saying she tried calling me. She said that sometimes her calls come through as blocked or unknown. I quickly realized I should have answered, I quickly responded apologizing. She called me not even five minutes after with a job offer. She asked if I needed time to consider... Nope! I am definitely a person that needs to work, I'm not cut-out to be unemployed. I think I would go insane from boredom.

Iâ€™m looking forward to the challenges this role presents. The challenge for me will not be implementing a SOC from the ground up. It's going to be making the most efficient security operations center that anyone has ever seen.
