# Update

After a seemingly endless search for employment, I've accepted a position as senior security engineer. I applied for the role a while back and got an email from their HR department to schedule a quick call. A couple days later I got an invite for a virtual meeting interview with the Director of IT and their lead engineer. During this time I was able to get an idea of their immediate security needs. Primary responsibilities would include building out a formal security operations center from the ground up and defining security policies, controls, and governance. Everything you would find in a traditional enterprise security operations center.

To my surprise, I received an email later that week with an invite for an in-person interview. The earliest availability was the following week; it felt like the longest week of my life. 


# Interview Readiness

Since BCBSA brought in a managed security service provider (MSSP) directly resulting in the non-renewal of contingent worker contracts, this has been the only face-to-face interview I've had since my last contract. Not letting the opportunity go to waste, I did some essential preparation. 

# Website Security Assessment 

I put together a security assessment of their website after performing a scan with nmap on the website's IPv4 address. From this scan I was able to determine what services the host was running, service versions, and the operating system. I provided a document listing each service and associated CVEs to that version along with remediation suggestions.  


In those recommendations I advised them to utilize Cloudflare's proxy feature for DNS records to obscure the host's physical address. Suggested moving all service listening addresses to local interfaces, using the Cloudflare Tunnel connector to expose services using published application routes, and eliminating any public port exposure. I informed them of the additional benefits this provides, such as SSL encryption under Cloudflare's SSL. Other recommendations included setting the SSHD listening address to an internal network address, completely eliminating internet-facing access. I also advised them on several ways to improve the security of their content management system.

## PowerPoint Presentation 

Following the assessment, I put together a PowerPoint showing that I took the time to research the company and understood their needs. I drafted a roadmap and three-phase timeline titled "SOC Implementation Essentials with SOAR Integration," assuming zero existing security posture. 

# Interview Day

Interview day started off pretty chaotically; I really wanted to get my haircut the day before. I wasn't able to due to financial constraints. It's a mystery to me how my wife has kept our heads above water while I've been looking for work; she is pretty amazing. She's attending Arizona College of Nursing to become a nurse, graduating with a BSN in 2027. All the while working full-time as an EMT/security guard for an upscale retirement community, accepting private-duty caregiving jobs as time permits. This opportunity could not have come at a better time; once I am back to work, she can focus on school again. 

Forty-five minutes before the interview, stubbornness got the best of me. I refused to go to an interview without looking my best. I have only recently let my hair grow out; I had a shaved head for years primarily for the convenience factor. I took a gamble and grabbed the clippers, shaving the sides and fading it. I figured in the worst-case scenario I'd temporarily revert to my old hairstyle. It's definitely a different experience cutting your own hair when you are not just shaving your entire head. Surprisingly, it turned out perfect. My wife had to do a slight touch-up on the back due to visual limitations. I'll just assume that luck played a big part in the success of that act of desperation. I won't be trying that again anytime soon. 

I made it to the interview just in time, meeting Jesse and his colleague at the door. We went to the interview room, and I immediately handed out a copy of the security assessment of their website as we sat down. After going over the assessment, I jokingly apologized, stating I geeked out and made a PowerPoint presentation... Midway through the presentation my mouth started to dry out; instead of panicking, I just called it out. Sorry, my mouth is a little dry. They were kind enough to get me some water. The presentation sparked some pretty good conversation, after which we took a trip down to the offices. I met some of the individuals from HR; overall, a cool experience. The best part was they loaded me up with a bunch of sample products. :) 

As I was about to exit the building, I tried to casually probe for information. Curious as to how many candidates they were interviewing. I grew a little concerned when he stated they couldn't share that information. I just hoped that the question didn't negatively impact the situation.

# Post Interview

 My wife asked how everything went, responding "I think it went well." A few hours later I received a couple calls from a blocked number, which I generally don't answer unless it's in my contacts. I use a separate number while searching for jobs that I unconditionally answer. I didn't realize I had listed my primary phone number when I applied; thankfully, I checked my email! 

 It was from Elizabeth in their human resource department, stating she tried to call and that the number might show as blocked or unknown. I replied with an apology for not answering; I generally don't answer blocked numbers, but I'll definitely make an exception for this instance. Five minutes later I got a call with a job offer. 

I found it a little amusing when she asked if I needed time to consider the offer. Nope! I'm definitely not cut out to be unemployed; boredom would eventually drive me insane. Iâ€™m looking forward to the challenges this role presents. The challenge for me will not be establishing a formal security operations center. I'm confident I can accomplish that; the challenge will be to produce something with far greater efficiency than one typically finds within an enterprise environment. I've had six months off work; I'm more than ready.
